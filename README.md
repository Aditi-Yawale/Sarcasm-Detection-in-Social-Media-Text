# Sarcasm Detection in Text

## Overview
The Sarcasm Detection System is a machine learning-based project designed to identify sarcastic text using various classification models. This system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and multiple algorithms, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Ridge Regression, to accurately detect sarcasm in textual data. The project aims to provide an effective tool for sentiment analysis, social media monitoring, or any application requiring nuanced text interpretation.

## Features
- **Multiple Models**: Implements SGD Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Ridge Regression for robust performance comparison.
- **NLP Preprocessing**: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction for optimal model input.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible to incorporate additional models or datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance assessment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sarcasm-detection-system.git
   cd sarcasm-detection-system
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Your Data**: Place your dataset (e.g., CSV file with text and labels) in the `data/` directory or update the data path in the configuration.
2. **Run the System**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will preprocess the data, train the models, and output the evaluation results.
3. **Customize**: Modify `config.py` to tweak model parameters, dataset paths, or preprocessing steps.

## Models
- **SGD Classifier**: A linear classifier optimized with stochastic gradient descent.
- **Logistic Regression**: A probabilistic model for binary classification.
- **Ridge Regression**: A regularized linear regression model adapted for classification.

## Dataset
The system is compatible with any labeled text dataset containing sarcastic and non-sarcastic examples. A sample dataset can be provided in `data/` or sourced externally (e.g., Kaggle, Twitter API).
